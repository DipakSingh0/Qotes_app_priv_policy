      <h2>Privacy Policy for Quotes App</h2>
      <p class="last-updated">
        Last Updated:
        <span id="currentDate">[October 21, 2025]</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how
        <strong id="companyName"></strong>
        we handle information in connection with your use
        of the Quotes App mobile application.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App is built with your privacy as a fundamental principle. We
        believe that an app designed to inspire should also
        respect your personal space and digital privacy. Therefore, we want to be
        absolutely clear:
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Data Collection Whatsoever</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App operates entirely offline and does not collect, store,
        transmit, or process any information from its users or their devices.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any
          personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email
          address, phone number, location, or unique device identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not track how you use the app.
          There is no logging of which quotes you view, how often you use the
          app, or your interactions with any features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Device Information:</strong> We do not collect any
          information about your device, such as your IP address, operating
          system, device model, or any other technical data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use any analytics tools
          (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, crash reporting services)
          that would gather information about your app usage or device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Internet Connection Required:</strong> The App functions
          completely offline once installed. It does not initiate any outgoing
          internet connections to transmit data. All functionality is contained
          locally within the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Session Persistence:</strong> Since no data is saved beyond
          the current session, there are no user profiles, settings, or
          history stored locally or remotely. Each use of the app is private and
          self-contained within your device.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any information, we do not use your information
        for any purpose, nor do we share it with any third parties. Your use of
        Quotes App is private, anonymous, and entirely contained within your
        device.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App does not integrate with any third-party services (such as
        advertising networks, social media SDKs, cloud storage, or analytics
        providers) that would collect or process user data.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App requires minimal permissions to function. The app may request
        notification permissions to alert you of the Quote of the Day or other content,
        but this operates entirely locally on your device. We do not access your
        camera, microphone, location, contacts, photos, or any other sensitive
        data on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable
        information from children under the age of 13, as it does not collect
        any information at all. The content of this app is suitable for all
        ages.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
        this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this
        Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are
        effective when they are posted on this page.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Inspiration, Your Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Quotes App is designed to be an inspiring and simple tool. This
        commitment extends to your privacyâ€”we will never distract you with data
        collection, tracking, or any other intrusions. Your interactions with quotes remain
        completely private and are never monitored, recorded, or analyzed.
      </p>
